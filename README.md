#     Swagger codegen

Problem statement:

Create the same REST API as in task #1, but use https://editor.swagger.io/ to create your API definition and generate the server code.

Choose any java-based server or server framework, that you like. You can either use the online editor or generate the code manually, e.g. using this document: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/server-stub-generator-howto. 

Make sure that you can deploy/run the generated code. Once your stub is ready - implement the same functionality as described in task #1, but now in java. Finally, be sure that you can show how your application responds to requests using postman, curl or any other HTTP client.


# Software's Used

- Spring Tool's(developing Spring Framework-based applications)

- Postman(to write functional tests, integration tests, regression tests, and more)

- MongoDB(for database)

## About spring tool's 

An Application Programming Interface (API) establishes a connection between computers or between computer programs (applications) by providing readily available codes and information pipelines. 

It is a type of software interface that acts as a mediator among other pieces of software to streamline the interaction with one other.

Owing to diverse application architectures, different types of APIs such as Program, Local, Web, or REST APIs assist developers in building robust digital solutions.

Representational State Transfer, also known as REST, is basically a standardized Software Architecture Style, or in simple words, a specific type of API used by the industry to establish a connection between Client and Server. 

REST API is built to guide the development and design of the World Wide Web’s architecture.

REST APIs provide a flexible, lightweight way of integrating computer applications. REST APIs are a simple and standardized approach to communication, which means we don’t have to worry about how to format your data, it’s all standardized and industry use.

REST APIs are scalable as well, which means as your service scales, you don’t have to worry about the growing complexity. 

we can easily make modifications to your data and keep track of that across Clients and Servers. 


## Creating project with spring tool's

Let’s create a simple spring application where we will implement standard MVC controller as well as REST controller. Create a “Demo” in Eclipse and then convert it to Maven project. 

This will provide us with maven based web application structure and we can build our application on top of it. Below image shows the final project structure of our Spring MVC Controller application.
